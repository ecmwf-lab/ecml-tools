.. warning::

   This documentation is work in progress. It is not yet ready.
   Currently, the documentation is based on the one from the ecml-tools_
   project, which will be merged into Anemoi.

*Anemoi* is a framework for developing machine learning weather
forecasting models. It comprises of components or packages for preparing
training datasets, conducting ML model training and a registry for
datasets and trained models. Anemoi provides tools for operational
inference, including interfacing to verification software. As a
framework it seeks to handle many of the complexities that
meteorological organisations will share, allowing them to easily train
models from existing recipes but with their own data.
