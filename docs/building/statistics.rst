Gathering statistics
====================

*Anemoi* will collect statistics about each variables in the dataset as it is created.
These statistics are intended to be used to normalise the data during training.

By defaults, the statistics are not computed on the whole dataset, but on a subset of
dates. The subset is defined using the following algorythm:

    - If the dataset covers more than 20 years, the last 3 years are excluded.
    - If the dataset covers more than 10 years, the last 2 years are excluded.
    - If the dataset covers more than 5 years, the last year is excluded.
    - Otherwise, 80% of the dataset is used.

You can override this behaviour by setting the `statistics_dates` parameter.

.. code-block:: yaml

    output:
        statistics_start: 2000
        statistics_end: 2020

.. todo:: List the statistics that are computed
